*You need to use full dependency text as including the link part.

For example,

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-support -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
    <artifactId>selenium-support</artifactId>
    <version>3.9.1</version>
</dependency>

*You need to name your pom file as pom.xml or you can modify it on Updater.java class.

Not: I'm currently working on a better Framework and I'm considering to add the project to maven repository.
